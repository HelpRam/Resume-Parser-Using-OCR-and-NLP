PROJECTS

LangChain QA Chatbot: Developed a Question-Answering chatbot using LangChain and the LLaMA model. Imple-
mented the chatbot to efficiently handle a wide range of queries by leveraging the LLaMA model’s natural language
processing capabilities. The project involved fine-tuning the model, integrating it with LangChain, and optimizing
the response accuracy, providing an interactive and user-friendly experience.

Image Caption Generator: Implemented an Image Caption Generator using a combination of the Flick8k dataset
and a personally curated collection of 150 real-world photos, each with corresponding captions. Leveraged the
VGG16 model for image feature extraction and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks for generating descriptive
captions. Achieved compelling results in automatically generating accurate and contextually relevant captions for
diverse images.

Student Performance Indicator: Conducted thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA), comparing the performance
of algorithms including KNeighborsRegressor, DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, and AdaBoostRe-
gressor, with Linear Regression emerging as the optimal choice. Trained and evaluated the model, achieving high
accuracy on test data.

Sign Language Detection: Developed a sign language detection system using the YOLOv8 model. Fine-tuned the
model with custom-created data to accurately identify and interpret sign language gestures. Utilized Roboflow
tools for efficient data annotation, ensuring high-quality training data. This project demonstrates the integration of
advanced computer vision techniques with custom model training for real-world applications.

Face Recognition Attendance System: An end-to-end face recognition attendance system, deployed with a user-
friendly interface using Tkinter, harnessing deep learning techniques to accurately identify and record individuals,
thereby streamlining attendance management workflows.

Handwritten Digit Classification: Handwritten Digit Classification is a deep learning project aimed at recognizing and
categorizing handwritten numerical digits. Utilizing advanced neural network architectures, the system analyzes input
images of handwritten digits, learning patterns and features to accurately classify them into predefined categories.
This project showcases the capability of deep learning algorithms to understand and interpret handwritten characters,
with applications in fields such as optical character recognition (OCR), digitized document processing, and automation
of data entry tasks.

Car Price Prediction: Created a project to estimate car prices by gathering data, training the system to learn from
it, and deploying it with Flask. The system provides an estimate of car prices, acting as a personal assistant for car
buying or selling.
